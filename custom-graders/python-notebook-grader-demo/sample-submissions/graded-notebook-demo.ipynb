    "\n",
    "This version is an example of a learner's submission. It features correctly completed graded cells, but using a different method than the model version. The autograder, in its default form, checks only the output of the functions, so these different but correct answers are marked as correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook has three noteable features:\n",
    "- It features a `# PACKAGE` cell, which imports packages required for the graded function to work\n",
    "- It contains 2 `# GRADED` cells, which the autograder must grade appropriately\n",
    "- It imports an external python file, contained within the `readonly` folder, which the autograder must also have access to\n",
    "\n",
    "The autograder takes a notebook file and converts it into a `.py` file containing functions defined in the notebook. In order to know which cells to capture, the cells must be labelled in the first line by a `package_id` or a `graded_id`. These are explained in more detail below."
